This Read Me includes a brief walkthrough of the websites functionality as well as changes that would have been made with the allowance of more time.  The top of the website is filled by the header.  In the header I include my name, email, phone number, and current location. The website exhibits three distinct pages; these pages are the home page, resume page, and contact page. The navigation bar allow transition between the three pages.   The navigation bar can be located centered beneath the header.  One distinct feature of the navigation bar is the highlighting effect when hovering over a button.  On the home page is a brief introduction of myself, including my interests and abilities.  The resume is a condensed version of my practicing resume but provides a downloadable pdf link to website viewers free for download.  Finally, the contact page includes my email, phone number, LinkedIn, also a contact form for website visitors to complete.  

With more time I would have elected to aesthetically improved the website.  By this I would have added more CSS and made the user experience improved.  I would introduce greater color scheme and potentially change font choice.  I would also like to add images of myself to personalize the site.  With more time I would have also like to include a page of previous papers and projects I have completed during my time at Illinois Tech.
