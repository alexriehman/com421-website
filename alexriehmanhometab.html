    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am Alex, a 21 year old student from the northwest suburb of Cary. However, I am currently studying in Chicago at Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
    <p>I am currently a fourth-year, pursuing an undergraduate degree in social and economic development policy, accompanied with a master’s degree in environmental management and sustainability.</p>
    
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>During my time at Illinois Tech, I have had opportunities to build real-world knowledge in sustainable development, relating to not only environmental considerations, but social and economic factors as well.</p>
    <p>I have completed an extensive coursework related to renewable development and suitable business practices, including economic analysis, optimization and decision making, environmental law, sustainable energy systems, and social entrepreneurship.</p>

    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <p>The accumulation of my intern, research, and university experiences have allowed for the development of a wealth of knowledge in conducting research, gathering written reports, and presenting final analyses of my findings.  Furthermore, my previous opportunities have refined my ability to time manage effectively and work successfully in collaborative settings.</p>
